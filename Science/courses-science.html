         Basically, to put it into simple terms, engineering is where you solve problems. To add a bit more to 
         it, engineers use technical, as well as scientific knowledge in order to make judgments. By using 
         their imaginations, they come up with solutions to problems either new or old. It is by using the 
         application of technical and scientific knowledge that engineers put judgment, imagination and 
         reasoning to work in order to come up with new solutions to human problems or new ways to solve old 
         problems. So, if that has left you feeling a bit hazy, the best way to summarize all of this is that 
         engineers are problem solvers.
