            Engineering is the application of science and math to solve problems. Engineers figure out how things work and find practical uses for scientific discoveries. It is a four year long course.

            <br>To work in most branches of engineering you need good math and science skills. Make sure to take and do well in as many high school classes in these subjects as possible. Chemistry, physics, biology, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, pre-calculus and calculus should certainly be part of your curriculum.
            
           <br><br><br><br> Students planning to study Engineering in India can choose from nearly 100 specialisations some of the most popular ones are stated below:
            <ul>
                <li> Electrical/electronic engineering </li>
            
                <li> Computer engineering </li>

        <h1 id="subheading">Eligibility criteria</h1>
        <p>
            The Eligibility Criteria for Engineering course are as follows:
          <ul>
              <li>Candidates must have passed Class XII exam from a recognised board with Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics as core subjects.</li>

              <li>They must also have secured minimum aggregate marks of 60 per cent in the above subjects combined</li> 

              <li>Age Limit: The age limit for the BAMS program is 20 years for general category and 24 years for reserved category.</li> 

              <li>The upper age limit to apply for MBBS programme is 25 years </li>

              <li>Most of the engineering institutes in India select candidates for admission on the basis of entrance exam scores and ranks. While some technical institutes accept AIR (All India Ranks) secured in national level exams, and some conduct their own entrance exam.
              <ol>
                  <li> Candidates have to apply for the entrance exam i.e. JEE and appear in it.</li> 

                  <li> After the results are out, the conducting authority of the examinations prepares a merit list, basis which counselling process is conducted. </li>

                  <li>Candidates who make it in the counselling process are allocated seats for Engineering course at different goverment colleges. </li>
                  </ol>
                  </li>
          </ul>
