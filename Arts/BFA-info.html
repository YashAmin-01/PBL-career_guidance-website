           BFA or Bachelor of Fine Arts is an undergraduate degree course which deals with the study of 
           Visual or Performing Arts. 
        </p>

        <p>
           The study of Visual Arts includes subjects such as painting, sculpture, photography, literature, 
           animation, etc. On the other hand, the study of Performing Arts involves subjects such as dance, 
           theatre and music. A Bachelor of Fine Arts degree often requires an area of specialisation to be 
           chosen by the candidate as per his/her interest.
           Depending on the candidate’s chosen specialisation, BFA is typically a three to four year duration 
           course that can be pursued as a full-time, part-time, online or distance-learning programme.          
        </p>

        <p>
            A BFA course not only educates but reforms the skills of candidates to enable them become artists 
            in their chosen field. Career opportunities for fine arts graduates are ample wherein they can 
            choose to be an art teacher, writer, fine artist, actor, art director, and a lot more. These days 
            many students are opting for a career in Fine Arts not only to earn high remuneration but also to 
            gain popularity and prestige.
